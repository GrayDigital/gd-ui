## Goals

Create a UI framework that forms the basis for Gray Digital's web presence.

- Start by recreating [gray.digital](https://www.gray.digital) website, public facing.
- Expand to internal apps that help run Gray Digital. (Rippling, Greenbridge, Engineering Community of Practice, etc.)

### Stretch Goals

- Incoproate Visual Regression Testing using Chromatic
- Practice continuous upgrades by using Dependabot to check for version bumps daily, relying on testing (visual and cypress) to ensure there are no regressions.

## Design

Utilizes Chakra-UI Pro Components. Gray has rights to the Application and Marketing package. Reachout to @ariperez for any of the code.
